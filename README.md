# WeatherGrains

WeatherGrains uses granular synthesis to generate music based on weather at different points on the globe.

Spin the globe around and _hear_ the weather! The temperature, cloud cover, wind speed, humidity, and air pressure are mapped to each channel's detuning, density, attack speed, release speed, and position randomization, respectively.

## Usage

```
python -m SimpleHTTPServer
```
and go to `localhost:8000`.
